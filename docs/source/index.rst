Welcome to QCEC's documentation!
================================

QCEC is a tool for quantum circuit equivalence checking developed by the Chair for Design Automation at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

QCEC is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT; formerly known as JKQ :cite:labelpar:`wille2020JKQtools` and developed by the [Institute for Integrated Circuits](https://iic.jku.at/eda/) at the [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://jku.at)).
It builds upon `our quantum functionality representation (QFR) <https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr>`_ and `our decision diagram (DD) package <https://github.com/cda-tum/dd_package.git>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via `quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de <mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de>`_ or by creating an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/issues>`_.
