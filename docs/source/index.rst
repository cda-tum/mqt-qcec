Welcome to QCEC's documentation!
================================

QCEC is a tool for :doc:`quantum circuit equivalence checking <EquivalenceChecking>` developed as part of the *Munich Quantum Toolkit* (*MQT*) [#]_ by the `Chair for Design Automation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/>`_ at the `Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de>`_. It builds upon `our quantum functionality representation (QFR) <https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr>`_, `our decision diagram (DD) package <https://github.com/cda-tum/dd_package.git>`_, and `our ZX-diagram package <https://github.com/cda-tum/zx.git>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via `quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de <mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de>`_ or by creating an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/issues>`_.
