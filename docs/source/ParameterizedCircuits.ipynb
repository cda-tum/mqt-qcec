    "## Variational Quantum Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational quantum algorithms are a family of mixed quantum-classical algorithms that try to achieve a quantum advantage via low-depth circuits. This is achieved by offloading a substantial amount of computational work to a classical processor. The quantum circuits employed by variational quantum algorithms involve *parameterized gates* which depend on some a-priori uninstantiated variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational quantum algorithms try to optimize the circuit's parameters in each iteration with the classical post-processor while the quantum circuit is used to compute the cost function that is being optimized. Because recompiling the quantum circuit in each of these iterations is a costly procedure, the circuit is usually compiled in *paramterized* form in which the parameters tuned by the classical optimization routine are not bound to specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case with parameter-free circuits, errors can be made during the compilation process. Therefore, verifying the correctness of compilations of parameterized quantum circuits is an important task for near-term quantum computing.\n",

    "## Equivalence Checking of Parameterized Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Having unbound parameters in a quantum circuits brings new challenges to the task of quantum circuit verification as many data structures have difficulty supporting symbolic computations directly. However, *ZX-diagrams* are an exceptions to this as most rewrite rules used for equivalence checking with the *ZX-calculus* only involve summation of parameters.\n",
    "The ZX-calculus equivalence checker in QCEC cannot be used to prove non-equivalence of quantum circuits. To still show non-equivalence of parameterized quantum circuits QCEC uses a scheme of repeatedly instantiating a circuits parameters in such a way as to make the check as simple as possible while still guaranteeing that either equivalence or non-equivalence can be proven.\n",
    "The resulting *equivalence checking flow* looks as follows\n",
