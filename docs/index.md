\begin{abstract}
```

MQT QCEC is an open-source C++17 and Python library for {doc}`quantum circuit equivalence checking <equivalence_checking>` developed as part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_ [^1].

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the MQT QCEC library, including {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`, a {doc}`quickstart guide <quickstart>`, and detailed {doc}`API documentation <api/mqt/qcec/index>`.
The source code of MQT QCEC is publicly available on GitHub at [munich-quantum-toolkit/qcec](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qcec), while pre-built binaries are available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qcec/) for all major operating systems and all modern Python versions.
MQT QCEC is fully compatible with Qiskit 1.0 and above.
