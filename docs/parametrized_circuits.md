# Verifying Parameterized Quantum Circuits

## Variational Quantum Algorithms

Variational quantum algorithms are a family of mixed quantum-classical algorithms that try to achieve a quantum advantage via low-depth circuits. This is achieved by offloading a substantial amount of computational work to a classical processor. The quantum circuits employed by variational quantum algorithms involve _parameterized gates_ which depend on some a-priori uninstantiated variable.

Variational quantum algorithms try to optimize the circuit's parameters in each iteration with the classical post-processor while the quantum circuit is used to compute the cost function that is being optimized. Because recompiling the quantum circuit in each of these iterations is a costly procedure, the circuit is usually compiled in _parameterized_ form in which the parameters tuned by the classical optimization routine are not bound to specific values.

As is the case with parameter-free circuits, errors can be made during the compilation process. Therefore, verifying the correctness of compilations of parameterized quantum circuits is an important task for near-term quantum computing.

## Equivalence Checking of Parameterized Quantum Circuits

Having unbound parameters in a quantum circuits brings new challenges to the task of quantum circuit verification as many data structures have difficulty supporting symbolic computations directly.
However, _ZX-diagrams_ are an exceptions to this as most rewrite rules used for equivalence checking with the _ZX-calculus_ only involve summation of parameters.
The ZX-calculus equivalence checker in QCEC cannot be used to prove non-equivalence of quantum circuits.
To still show non-equivalence of parameterized quantum circuits QCEC uses a scheme of repeatedly instantiating a circuits parameters in such a way as to make the check as simple as possible while still guaranteeing that either equivalence or non-equivalence can be proven.
The resulting _equivalence checking flow_ looks as follows

## Using QCEC to Verify Parameterized Quantum Circuits

Consider the following quantum circuit

```{code-cell} ipython3
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

alpha = Parameter("alpha")
beta = Parameter("beta")

qc_lhs = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc_lhs.rz(alpha, 1)
qc_lhs.cx(0, 1)
qc_lhs.rz(beta, 1)
qc_lhs.cx(0, 1)
qc_lhs.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

A well known commutation rule for the $R_Z$ gate, states that this circuit is equivalent to the following one

```{code-cell} ipython3
qc_rhs = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc_rhs.cx(0, 1)
qc_rhs.rz(beta, 1)
qc_rhs.cx(0, 1)
qc_rhs.rz(alpha, 1)
qc_rhs.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

This equality can be proved with QCEC by using the {py:func}`.verify` function just as with any regular circuit

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt import qcec

qcec.verify(qc_lhs, qc_rhs)
```

QCEC also manages to show non-equivalence of parameterized quantum circuits.
It is easy to erroneously exchange the parameters in the above commutation rule.

```{code-cell} ipython3
qc_rhs_err = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc_rhs_err.cx(0, 1)
qc_rhs_err.rz(alpha, 1)
qc_rhs_err.cx(0, 1)
qc_rhs_err.rz(beta, 1)
qc_rhs_err.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

QCEC will tell us that this is incorrect

```{code-cell} ipython3
qcec.verify(qc_lhs, qc_rhs_err)
```
