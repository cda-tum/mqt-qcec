# References

*QCEC* is academic software. Thus, many of its built-in algorithms have been published as scientific papers.

If you use *QCEC* in your work, we would appreciate if you cited {cite:p}`burgholzer2021advanced` (which subsumes {cite:p}`burgholzer2020ImprovedDDbasedEquivalence` and {cite:p}`burgholzer2020PowerSimulationEquivalence`).

Furthermore, if you use any of the particular algorithms such as

- the compilation flow result verification scheme {cite:p}`burgholzer2020verifyingResultsIBM`,
- the dedicated stimuli generation schemes {cite:p}`burgholzer2021randomStimuliGenerationQuantum`,
- the transformation scheme for circuits containing non-unitaries {cite:p}`burgholzer2022handlingNonUnitaries`,
- the equivalence checker based on ZX-diagrams {cite:p}`peham2022equivalenceCheckingZXCalculus`, or
- the method for checking equivalence of parameterized circuits {cite:p}`peham2023EquivalenceCheckingParameterizedCircuits`

please consider citing their respective papers as well. A full list of references is given below.
