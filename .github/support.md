# Support

If you are stuck with a problem using QCEC or are having questions, please do get in touch at our [Issues](https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/discussions). We'd love to help.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:

- Do try to solve the problem on your own first. Make sure to consult the [documentation](https://qcec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Search through past [issue](https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec/issues) to see if someone else already had the same problem.
- Before filing a bug report, try to create a minimal working example (MWE) that reproduces the problem. It's much easier to identify the cause for the problem if a handful of lines suffice to show that something isn't working.
