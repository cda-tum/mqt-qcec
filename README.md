## Usage

MQT QCEC is mainly developed as a C++ library with an easy-to-use Python interface.

- In order to make the library as easy to use as possible (without compilation), we provide pre-built wheels for most common platforms (64-bit Linux, MacOS, Windows). These can be installed using
    ```bash
    pip install mqt.qcec
    ```
  However, in order to get the best performance out of QCEC, it is recommended to build it locally from the source distribution (see [system requirements](#system-requirements)) via
    ```bash
    pip install mqt.qcec --no-binary mqt.qcec
    ```
  This enables platform specific compiler optimizations that cannot be enabled on portable wheels.
- Once installed, start using it in Python:
    ```python
    from mqt.qcec import *
    
    config = Configuration()
    <...>  # set configuration options
    results = verify(circ1, circ2, config)
    ```
Both circuits can either be IBM Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` objects or paths to circuit files (in any of the formats listed above). 

The verification procedure can be configured with the following settings and options:
 - General settings:
    - `method`: Equivalence checking method to use
        - reference
        - ![G \rightarrow \mathbb{I} \leftarrow G'](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cmathbb%7BI%7D%20%5Cleftarrow%20G') (*default*)
        - simulation
    - `tolerance`: Numerical tolerance used during computation (`1e-13` per default)
- Settinggs for the ![G \rightarrow \mathbb{I} \leftarrow G'](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cmathbb%7BI%7D%20%5Cleftarrow%20G') method:
    - `strategy`: Strategy to use for the scheme
        - naive
        - proportional (*default*)
        - lookahead
        - compilationflow
    - `identity_threshold`: Numerical tolerance used for checking the similarity to the identity matrix (`1e-10` per default)
- Settings for the simulation-based method:
    - `fidelity`: Fidelity limit for comparison (`0.999` per default)
    - `max_sims`: Maximum number of simulations to conduct (`16` per default)
    - `stimuli_type`: Type of stimuli to use
        - classical (*default*)
        - localquantum
        - globalquantum
    - `store_cex_input`: Store counterexample input state vector (*off* by default)
    - `store_cex_output`: Store resulting counterexample state vectors (*off* by default)
- optimizations:
    - `reconstruct_swaps`: Reconstruct SWAP operations from consecutive CNOTs (*on* per default)
    - `fuse_single_qubit_gates`: Fuse consecutive single qubit gates (*on* per default)
    - `remove_diagonal_gates_before_measure`: Remove diagonal gates before measurements (*off* by default)
    - `tranform_dynamic_circuit`: Transform dynamic to static circuit (*off* by default)
    - `reorder_operations`: Reorder operations in order to eliminate unnecessary dependencies (*on* by default)
    
The `qcec.Results` class that is returned by the `verify` function provides `json()` and `csv()` methods to produce JSON or CSV formatted output.

### Integration of IBM Qiskit

The MQT QCEC tool is designed to natively integrate with IBM Qiskit. In particular, using our tool to verify, e.g., the results of IBM Qiskit's quantum circuit compilation flow, is as easy as:
```python
from mqt.qcec import Configuration, Strategy, verify
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

# create your quantum circuit
qc = <...> 

# append measurements to save output mapping of physical to logical (qu)bits
qc.measure_all() 

# compile circuit to appropriate backend using some optimization level
qc_comp = transpile(qc, backend=<...>, optimization_level=<0 | 1 | 2 | 3>) 

# set dedicated verification strategy
config = Configuration()
config.strategy = Strategy.compilationflow

# verify the compilation result
result = verify(qc, qc_comp, config)
```

### Command-line Executable

MQT QCEC also provides a **standalone executable** with command-line interface called `qcec_app`. It provides the same options as the Python module as flags (e.g., `--method <method>` for setting the method) and produces JSON formatted
output. For a full list of options, call `qcec_app --help`.

### System requirements

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, MacOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments). However, the implementation should be compatible
with any current C++ compiler supporting C++17 and a minimum CMake version of 3.14.

*Disclaimer*: We noticed some issues when compiling with Microsoft's `MSCV` compiler toolchain. If you are developing under Windows, consider using the `clang` compiler toolchain. A detailed description of how to set this up can be
found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-160).

### Library Organisation

Internally the MQT QCEC library works in the following way

- Import both input files into a `qc::QuantumComputation` object
    ```c++
    std::string file1 = "<PATH_TO_FILE_1>";
    qc::QuantumComputation qc1(file1);
    
    std::string file2 = "<PATH_TO_FILE_2>";
    qc::QuantumComputation qc2(file2);
    ```
- Instantiate an `ec::EquivalenceChecker` object with both circuits
    ```c++
    auto eq = ec::EquivalenceChecker(qc1, qc2);
    ```
    or
    ```c++
    auto eq = ec::ImprovedDDEquivalenceChecker(qc1, qc2);
    ```
    or
    ```c++ 
    auto eq = ec::SimulationBasedEquivalenceChecker(qc1, qc2);
    ```
    or 
    ```c++ 
    auto eq = ec::CompilationFlowEquivalenceChecker(qc1, qc2);
    ```
- Set configuration options, e.g.,
    ```c++
    ec::Configuration config{};
    config.tolerance = 1e-8;
    config.strategy = ec::Strategy::Lookahead;
    ```
- Perform the actual equivalence check
    ```c++
    auto results = eq.check(config);
    ```
- Print the results
    ```c++
    results.printJSON();
    ```

### Setup, Configure, and Build

To start off, clone this repository using
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec 
```
Note the `--recurse-submodules` flag. It is required to also clone all the required submodules. If you happen to forget passing the flag on your initial clone, you can initialize all the submodules by executing `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the main project directory.

Our projects use CMake as the main build configuration tool. Building a project using CMake is a two-stage process. First, CMake needs to be *configured* by calling
```shell 
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
This tells CMake to search the current directory `.` (passed via `-S`) for a *CMakeLists.txt* file and process it into a directory `build` (passed via `-B`).
The flag `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` tells CMake to configure a *Release* build (as opposed to, e.g., a *Debug* build).

After configuring with CMake, the project can be built by calling
```shell
 cmake --build build --config Release
```
This tries to build the project in the `build` directory (passed via `--build`).
Some operating systems and developer environments explicitly require a configuration to be set, which is why the `--config` flag is also passed to the build command. The flag `--parallel <NUMBER_OF_THREADS>` may be added to trigger a parallel build.

Building the project this way generates
- the main library `libqcec.a` (Unix) / `qcec.lib` (Windows) in the `build/src` directory
- the commandline executables `qcec_app` and `qcec_sim_app` (for simulation-based verification) in the `build/apps` directory
- a test executable `qcec_test` containing a small set of unit tests in the `build/test` directory (only if `-DBUILD_QCEC_TESTS=ON` is passed to CMake during configuration)

### Extending the Python Bindings

To extend the Python bindings you can locally install the package in edit mode, so that changes in the Python code are instantly available.
The following example assumes you have a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) set up and activated.

```commandline
(venv) $ pip install cmake
(venv) $ pip install --editable .
```

If you change parts of the C++ code, you have to run the second line to make the changes visible in Python.
